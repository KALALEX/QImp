ADD UNARY OPERATORS! (- 5), (hermitianConj [1 0]) etc --- DONE
ADD COMPLEX NUMBERS! 1+0i  --- DONE
Also add parsing for negative numbers: -5 , -3 etc instead of having to use unary operators all the time  --- DONE


=================

maybe remove () from if?

if #t

if eq(1,2)

if (1 = 2)


might look better

------

implement pattern matching?
this might be a better/cleaner structure than if-multiple elifs-else 

possible syntax: ? 
let f = lambda(b){
 	 match b with
  		| true -> 1
  		| false -> 0
	}
