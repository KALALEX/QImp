TODO: 
add a function ( getElement(list,index)) 
or special grammar (list[index])  

to access list elements at will 
---------------------
Actually no, I think i'll keep lists immutable.
So i think the function is better.
list[index] with immutable lists is awkward, it would return a new list/element
but it looks like you are accessing the same list
The function is much better looking, you know you are getting an element and not modifying a list

------

PARTIAL APPLICATION !

if inputs < numberOfArguments:
	return function(remaining arguments): body
	where the functions' env has been updated with new bindings

hmmm 

or just delete some arguments from the function's list of arguments and update its env with new bindings
----

maybe remove () from if?

if #t

if eq(1,2)

if (1 = 2)


might look better
